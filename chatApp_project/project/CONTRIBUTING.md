# Contribution Guideline

When contributing to this repository, make sure you ALWAYS create a branch, you should never directly push to master, any code directly pushed to master will be removed without any warnings.

## Commit Messages

Your commit messages must follow conventional commits format: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/

## Pull Requests

When you are ready to submit your code, you issue a pull request. You don't have to finish the whole feature to submit a pull request, however you should make sure your PR doesn't break the system.

Choose an apporporite reviewer for your PR, every PR must be reviewed by at least one other person to be merged. You probably want to private message the reviewer to let he/she know there is a PR pending review.

Once the reviewer approves your PR, you are responsible for merging it. So please please make sure you check your email frequently.

When merging, you must choose [Squash and Merge].

## Moving JIRA Tickets

Once a PR is merged, you can move the apporporite JIRA ticket to DONE.

## Reviewing PRs

If you are chosen to review a PR, do so carefully. Understand what is being changed and pull the code locally to run it on your own computer.

Always approve if you cannot prove there is a bug, I trust everyone here to know how to use linters and auto formatting to fix all style issues.

Try to finish review a PR within 24 hours after it is issued.
