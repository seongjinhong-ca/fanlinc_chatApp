# Sprint Retrospective

## Bad Things

* Better time management, so no all commits last day of the sprint.

* Microservice initialization/usage documentation should be more descriptive and intuitive. Since all of the microservices are using different technologies, not everyone may know how to run/use the service.

* Standups should contain more details. For example: if you learned something, say what part you have learned. This will help the team better gauge the progress of the sprint.

* As we are beginning to integrate all of the services together, it is difficult communicate complex ideas through a text based communication medium. As a result, we need to have more in-person meetings.

* We need to start to clean-up the branches (delete them after merge) to facilitate better organization.

## Good Things

* Having daily stand-up is good, it helped identify problems early on.

* Clean commit messages (squash and merge) summarized the key purpose of commits.

* Meaningful branch names that contain the task number helped associate branches with their purpose.

* Efficient daily communication between team members through a Discord channel established good rapport amongst the members.
