## Good practices to keep

* Good code review process, every PR is reviewed by at least another person.

* Squash and merge, nice and clean.

* Open communication through the use of a Discord channel allowed to teamwork to neatly flow.

* A helpful atmosphere where teammembers do their best to help each other created a supportive environment to uplift the entire team.

* An understanding outlook for granting internal extensions to team deadlines. For example, for very big PRs, teammembers will allow reviewers multiple days to properly review the PR instead of strictly adhereing to the internally set deadline.

* Our teammembers each have expertise in a variety of fields and technologies. Assigning teammembers with experience in a related field to a given task helps streamline work.

* The PR review policy worked well to keep everyone responsible for the work as a team and assured all teammembers had the opportunity to understand systems they were not working on.

## Bad practices to improve on

* We kept work to the last day of the sprint, this is bad and we will improve on it for Sprint 2.

* System documentation is lacking which makes it hard for people to install the program on their machine. We will retain more rigourous documentation standards.

* We need to better adapt to the Agile development method. Using the TAs car example, instead of first builing a bicycle we built a nice stearing wheel with no frame to attach it to.

* It took a bit of time to build a working dynamic with some teammates. This has improved greatly since the start of the sprint, and we expect it to progress as the project develops.

* We need to maintian better documentation for the technologies we use. Not everyone has had experience with certain frameworks, databases, etc. It would be helpful to maintain an overview of the system in the respective README.md of the service.
