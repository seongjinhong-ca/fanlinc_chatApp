Chris
sorry for not posting what i did for past few days.
Did:
     *nothing (today I did nothing due to a mark changed from 87% to 50% for one of my courses. I was busy dealing with that problem since i woke up today, and yes this sounds like an excuse...)
Will do:
      *will catch up with my work
      *will talk about what i did in past few days when I did not post daily stand ups.
blocked: 
      *the marking issue didn't solve yet.
