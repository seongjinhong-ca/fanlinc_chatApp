# [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)

Reddit is an social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Users submit content in different forms such as links, text posts, and images. Other members can vote up or down on each post to make it appear higher on home interface.

#### How our product differs:

- We are creating a platform where fans can discover **local** groups while Reddit is centered around global groups.
- We are also creating a platform where moderators can create **events** for group members to attend which Reddit currently does not support.
- Our product also contains a third level for defining a user/community which is their expertise in the topic which Reddit does not support currently.

Our product is better for users wanting to connect with other users since the virtual communities in our project are localized. For example a expert gamer wanting to connect with other expert gamers in his/her local area can do so by joining certain communities in our product.

# [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)

Facebook is an online social media and networking website. Users interact with other users across the globe, create posts, notify others about events and also sell products.

#### How our product differs:

- Facebook is more **centered around users** while our product is more centered around certain topics.
- Users can view content they are not 'friends' with and vice versa user can post **content for everyone** to view.

Our product is better for users wanting to share and receive content to and by everyone. The users of our product want to connect with other users who share similar taste and also at the same **level of expertise**.

# [Discord](https://discordapp.com)

Discord is a free voice, video, and text chat app created initially for gamers now used by all types of users. Communities are created by users in which the members can discuss about anything with other members.

#### How our product differs:

- Our application is centered around communities and holding local **events** which discord cannot perform currently.
- Users can also see the news feed of the communities they follow and respond directly from the home interface which discord currently does not support.
- Users will also have the option to select the **level of expertise** in the topic to have conversation with other similar users which Discord currently does not support.

Our product is better due to the fact users can hold local events for other users to attend which Discord cannot do perform. Discord did not focus on creating local communities is due to the fact Discord was initially created for gamers to communicate on, whom are spread across the globe.

# [Amino](https://aminoapps.com)

Amino is a communication platform which allows users to explore, discover and obsess over things they are into. Amino is a community centered social media network rather than a user centered. Users can chat with other users across the globe, post their own blogs and pictures, and also discover other interesting communities to join.

#### How our product differs:

- Our product allows users to set up **events** for the community to hold which Amino cannot perform due to the scale of it's application.
- Users will also have the option to select the **level of expertise** while joining communities to socialize with users of similar level of expertise. Amino allows users to join one community for all types of users and cannot differentiate different users.

Our product is better due to the fact users can hold local events for other users to attend which Amino cannot do perform. Our product is better for users wanting to connect with other users in real life and make new friends who share similar interests through our product.
