### 1. Team Organization

Our group divided our tasks and organized the group by sharing Google documents. In lieu of Jira, we used a spreadsheet to organize, track, and update the status of each task, so that all the members know what has been completed and what needs to be completed. We did not explicitly assign any one single task to a single person, but rather we had everyone contribute to multiple tasks and edit all tasks. In this manner, everyone would fully understand the expectations and outcomes of this project. As a team, we continuously helped and checked up on each other to ensure that no one fell behind. 

### 2. Decision Making

When we need to make a decision, usually we discuss internally within the team first, and make a final decision by a simple majority vote. If in serious doubt, we would consult the product owner: FanLinc. This is to ensure our PO would only address the most important and relevant concerns about the product.
If the decision involves the removal of a feature, we would consult the PO first before making the decision.

### 3. User Stories

We used the classic MSCW method to prioritize user stories. We first divided user stories into Must-Haves, Should-Haves, Could-Haves and Wonâ€™t-Haves, then we looked into each story within each category and assigned a unique numeric value based on effort-to-value ratio. A lower number defines a higher priority.

When our group was assigning story points for each user story, all of the members selected a number from a subset of the Fibonacci sequence to approximate the difficulty of each user story. When there were conflicting point assignments, we held a brief discussion on why each individual felt that a story deserved the amount of points they selected before re-voting. On average, we had 3 rounds of voting before all of the members agreed on the ideal story points approximation.

### 4. Meetings

Our group first held an in-person meeting and spent over three hours drafting overall plans for how our group would achieve the FanLinc project. These plans included but were not limited to desired application features, user interface design, and the feasibility to deliver analysis. After the meeting, the members actively connected on a daily basis through an online group chat to discuss project issues and progress towards completion. 

### 5. Next phase

Even though we kept in touch daily through an online medium, we never had any formal meeting schedule. As a result, it was often difficult to have the entire group in a discussions at once. Therefore, we will be implementing a meeting schedule from this point onwards so that we are able to have the entire team in group discussions. 

Furthermore, our file organization system was not perfect. Even though we utilized Google documents to work together on tasks, these documents were scattered everywhere and it was very difficult to find the link to a certain document. As a result, we will be creating a shared Google Drive folder to store all shared documents and resources. In effect, each member will only have to maintain the single shared Google Drive folder link to access all the documentation and GitHub to access all the code.

Lastly, we found that the single trail Facebook Messenger chat was ineffective in organizing discussions on different topics. Consequently, we will be moving our online communication medium to a Discord Server to better organize discussions through discussion channels. We selected this over Slack as a team organization tool with free group voice calling.
